# A program that reads temperature in degrees Celsius from the keyboard.
# Use comments to briefly describe the program's algorithm.
#
# determine temperature in C
c=int(input('The temperature in degrees Celsius is: '))
# determine formula for Farenheit
f=c*1.8+32
# determine formula for Kelvin
k=c+273.15
# print result
print("Temperature in Fahrenheit is ", f, 'and temperature in Kelvin is ', k)
